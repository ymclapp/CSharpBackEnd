##   App Summary:
This is my e-commerce app.  Currently there are category and products pages.  You can see details of the products in each category.
##  The app in action:
There is an Admin Dashboard link at the top of the screen.  That will take you to the Categories and Products links.  When you click on the Categories link, you will get the opportunity to not only view what categories there currently are, but also add more or change what is there.  When you click on Details for a category, you are able to see  the products and their details.

Now, with specific roles, you cannot conduct certain processes without the appropriate role  Additionally, we added cookies to remember the user.

I created Razor Pages for the My Account, to do a Search, and for the results of clicking on a specific product

There is an active products table that shows the items for sale.  You are able to add to cart.  I'm working on getting the cart items to be the actual item that was added to the cart.  I added the email service to the app.  Working on adding the customer registration process.
